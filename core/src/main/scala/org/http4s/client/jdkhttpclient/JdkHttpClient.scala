    // Convert the JDK HttpResponse into a http4s Response value.
    //
    // Aside form converting between the JDK types and the http4s types, this
    // function also ensures that the body of the response is properly
    // handled.
    //
    // From the JDK docs for HttpResponse#BodyHandlers.ofPublisher,
    // https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.html#ofPublisher()
    //
    // > When the HttpResponse object is returned, the response headers will
    // > have been completely read, but the body may not have been fully
    // > received yet. The HttpResponse.body() method returns a
    // > Publisher<List<ByteBuffer>> from which the body response bytes can be
    // > obtained as they are received. The publisher can and must be subscribed
    // > to only once.
    //
    // Of particular note is the final sentence, "The publisher can and must
    // be subscribed to only once.".
    //
    // This poses a bit of a problem for us in the cases where the body is not
    // inspected, e.g. org.http4s.client.Client#status or any function which
    // doesn't inspect the response body in
    // org.http4s.client.Client#run. Functions such as these will never
    // attempt to pull from the fs2.Stream, and it will just silently leave
    // scope and in doing so never subscribe to the JDK HttpResponse body
    // Publisher.  This is because functions provided by fs2 for converting a
    // reactive streams publisher into a fs2.Stream explicitly and
    // intentionally _do not_ subscribe to the publisher until the first
    // attempt to pull from the Stream.
    //
    // https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/blob/v2.5.0/reactive-streams/src/main/scala/fs2/interop/reactivestreams/StreamSubscriber.scala#L64
    //
    // In the general case, this is fine and probably even ideal. After all if
    // you are never going to pull from a Stream, why do all the setup work?
    //
    // Unfortunately, the reactive streams semantics for the JDK client are
    // not the "general case". In order to not leak resources, there _must_ be
    // _exactly one_ subscription to the body publisher _and_ it must either
    // be read until it is exhausted or `.cancel` _must_ be invoked.
    //
    // Making matters more complicated, fs2's implementation does not provide
    // any way to directly invoke this type of operation, e.g. subscribe and
    // then immediately cancel.
    //
    // Thus, in order to solve this problem and satisfy the JDK HttpResponse's
    // API so as to not leak resources, we do the following.
    //
    // We create a Deferred[F, Unit] and bracket its creation as well as
    // the invocation of the effect which yields the JDK HttpResponse. Using
    // the lower level fs2 reactive streams APIs, we ensure the attempt to
    // subscribe to the Publisher first completes the Deferred. The
    // code for this is similar to the body of the fromPublisher method in fs2.
    //
    // https://github.com/typelevel/fs2/blob/v2.5.0/reactive-streams/src/main/scala/fs2/interop/reactivestreams/package.scala#L55
    //
    // In the release section of bracket on the response, we check if the
    // Deferred has been completed. If that is not the case that means
    // that Publisher was never subscribed to, either due to an error or more
    // likely because the calling code didn't care about the body of the
    // request. In this case we subscribe to the body and then immediately
    // cancel the subscription, freeing the resources.  If the Deferred
    // has already been completed, we do nothing.
    //
    // There are a couple items worth giving special attention to here.
    //
    // * It is important that we attach the finalizer which can run
    // AlwaysCancelingSubscriber as soon as we run the effect to trigger the
    // response. We _could_ attach it later, e.g. when we attach the body
    // interruption signal, but this happens after a number of other side
    // effects are run. If anything triggers abnormal termination _after_ we
    // have the HttpResponse, but _before_ we've attached this finalizer, then
    // we will have a resource leak.
    //
    // * Interrupting the response body stream alone will not trigger
    // subscription and cancellation. Subscription only happens after someone
    // attempts to pull from the Stream, which doesn't happen in cases where
    // the body is discarded. Interrupting the fs2.Stream with a second
    // Resource is still required to cleanup the fs2.Stream scopes, whether or
    // not the Publisher was ever subscribed to.
